HOW TO TEST YOUR SCRIPT USING XAMPP ON YOUR LOCAL MACHINE

1. Go to the Apache Friends website, download XAMPP and install on your desktop

2. Clone the github repo in the "HTDocs" folder located under the "XAMMP" folder on your C: drive. The file path is "C:\xampp\htdocs" for your Web server.

3. Add your script file to the script folder of the repo

4. Start the XAMPP program

5. Click on the "Start" button next to "Apache" to start your Apache Web server. When Apache is running, the word "Running" will appear next to it, highlighted in green.

6. Open up any Web browser on your desktop and enter "localhost/"reponame"/index.php?json" into the address box and voila you will see if your script passed or not.
